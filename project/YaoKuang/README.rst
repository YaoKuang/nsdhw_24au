Optimized C++ Research
===================
Proven techniques for heightened performance.

Basic Information
----------------
Proven techniques for heightened performance, and the ref code is house in its repository: https://github.com/SeattleCpp?tab=repositories

Problem to Solve
----------------
Exploit the following opportunities to improve code performance:

• Use better libraries, and use libraries better.

• Reduce memory allocation.

• Reduce copying.

• Remove computation.

• Increase concurrency.

• Optimize memory management.

Prospective Users
----------------
It is difficult for developers to reason about the effects of individual coding decisions on the overall performance of a large program. Thus, practically all complete programs contain significant opportunities for optimization. Even code produced by experienced teams with plenty of time can often be sped up by a factor of 30%–100%.

System Architecture
----------------
The mix of features in C++ provides a continuum of implementation choices ranging
from hands-off automation and expressiveness on one hand, to increasingly fine con‐
trol over performance on the other hand. It is this degree of choice that makes it pos‐
sible to tune C++ programs to meet requirements for performance.
C++ has its “usual suspects” for optimization hot spots, including function calls,
memory allocation, and loops.
